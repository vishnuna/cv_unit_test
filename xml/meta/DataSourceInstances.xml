<!-- this object encapsulates all instances for a given data source -->
<!-- to minimize storage and search burden, we'll store a DataSourceTables object
 - a collection of DataTableLayout objects for a data source - 
 separately from DataSourceInstances object (as the table objects are used much less frequently, only for
 rebuilding the tables). We will even serialize them to a separate table.
 
 DataSourceTables object will have an id matching the id of the data source, and
 each individual DataTableLayout subobject will have the same id as the data source instance subobject inside
 DataSourceInstances.
